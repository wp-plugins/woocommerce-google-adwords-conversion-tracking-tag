This plugin inserts a Google AdWords conversion tracking tag into the thankyou page of a WooCommerce shop, also measuring the conversion value.

== Description ==

This plugin enables Google AdWords conversion value tracking for WooCommerce orders. This is important if you want to measure the ROI of your campaigns.
 
== Installation ==

1. Upload the wgact plugin directory into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Get the AdWords conversion ID and the conversion label. You will find both values in the AdWords conversion tracking code. 
4. In the WordpPress admin panel go to settings and then into the WGACT Plugin Menu. Please enter the conversion ID and the conversion label into their respective fields. 
5. Delete any other instances of the AdWords tracking code which tracks sales. (You might have several AdWords tracking codes, eg. tracking newsletter applications. Keep those.)
6. Delete the cache on your server and on your browser.
7. Check if the AdWords tag is running fine by placing a test order (ideally click on one of your AdWords ads first) and then check with the Google Tag Assistang browser plugin if the tag has been inserted corretly on the thank you page.
