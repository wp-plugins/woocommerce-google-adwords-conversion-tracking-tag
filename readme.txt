This plugin inserts a Google AdWords conversion tracking tag into the thankyou page of a WooCommerce shop, also measuring the conversion value.

== Description ==

This plugin fills a small gap in the tracking of Google AdWords conversions in conjunction with WooCommerce. Whereas other available plugins inject a static AdWords tracking tag, this plugin is dynamic and  enables the tracking code to also measure the total value of the transaction.  This is important if you want to measure the ROI of the AdWords account. Sure this can be done in different ways, but for everyone who would like to use this feature with WooCommerce and AdWords, this is the right plugin. It has been tested with Wordpress 3.6, WooCommerce 2.0.13 and the WooCommerce theme Wootique 1.6.7, though the plugin should work with all WooCommerce themes.
 
== Installation ==

1. Upload the wgact plugin directory into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Get the AdWords conversion ID and the conversion label. You will find both values in the AdWords conversion tracking code. 
4. In the WordpPress admin panel go to settings and then into the WGACT Plugin Menu. Please enter the conversion ID and the conversion label into their respective fields.
